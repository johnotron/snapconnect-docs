SNAP Connect Licensing
======================

There are two licensing options available when using *SNAP Connect*:

Free Evaluation License (10 nodes or less)
------------------------------------------

A “fixed address, 10-node” license is provided with the *SNAP Connect* library. Applications that only require a small
number of SNAP nodes (up to 10 embedded SNAP Nodes, not counting the *SNAP Connect* application and optionally Portal)
require no additional license.

Every node on a SNAP network must have a unique SNAP address. The address of *SNAP Connect* nodes using the free
evaluation will be fixed at SNAP Address 00.00.20.

Unrestricted License (more than 10 nodes)
-----------------------------------------

To move your *SNAP Connect* instance to a different (unique) address or to use more than 10 nodes in your network,
requires a license file which specifies what SNAP addresses you are authorized to use. Contact Synapse at 1-877-982-7888
or e-mail SNAPconnectlicense@synapse-wireless.com to order one or more *SNAP Connect* licenses.

Once you have obtained your ``License.dat`` file, copy it to the same directory as your application software.

.. note:: Synapse gateways (such as the *SNAP Connect* E10) include an unrestricted *SNAP Connect* license.

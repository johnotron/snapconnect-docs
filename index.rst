SNAP Connect Python Package
===========================

*SNAP Connect* |version| is a pure Python package to interface your application to a SNAP network. This Python package
is a full SNAP implementation, allowing you to create programs that natively interact with the SNAP network.

If you are not already familiar with SNAP networking and SNAPpy scripting please refer to Synapseâ€™s **SNAP Primer**,
**SNAP User Guide**, and **SNAP Reference Manual**. These documents can be found on the
`Synapse website <http://www.synapse-wireless.com>`_ or within the Help menu of Synapse Wireless *Portal* software.
It is strongly recommended that you become familiar with the contents of this reference manual and have the *Portal*
software installed before attempting to develop custom applications using *SNAP Connect*. This document also assumes
that you have a good working knowledge of the Python programming language.
